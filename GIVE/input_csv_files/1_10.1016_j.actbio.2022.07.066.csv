Statement of significance,"Bacterial infection and local growth factor deficiency are two of the major causes for the nonunion of refractory wounds. In the present study, an injectable carrier-free hydrogel was constructed of a natural antimicrobial peptide J-1 and 8Br-cAMP by eco-friendly physical crosslinking without any other gelators or chemical crosslinking agents. The hydrogel exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity and was proved to promote the secretion of TGF-β and VEGFA in vitro and in vivo . Correspondingly, the hydrogel showed exceptionally wound healing effects in the wound model of MRSA infected diabetic rats. This study would provide an alternative strategy or a potential hydrogel dressing for the treatment of chronic or refractory wounds."

Introduction,"Wounds caused by trauma, surgery, burns, etc. often damage the skin and normal function of the human body, as the skin is the largest organ of the human body and protects the human body from external invasion, electrolyte loss, and body water evaporation [ 1 , 2 ] . In the initial stage of wound healing, the inflammatory response is considered the key stage for the body to remove infected bacteria and create a tissue environment conductive to regeneration and repair. However, the increase of local necrotic tissue, deteriorated local blood vessels, increase pro-inflammatory cytokines caused by pathogen infection, diabetes, and other factors, would make the wound in a state of pathological inflammation, persistent infection, and necrosis. Following, the subsequent repair process would stop and form a chronic wound, which would cause severe discomfort and significantly impact on patients' lives [3] [4] [5] . In addition to delaying wound healing and aggravating scars, it will also lead to other complications and risk factors [ 6 , 7 ] . However, there is no effective treatment for such kinds of wounds, especially the wounds infected by multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) [8] [9] [10] ."
Introduction,"Because the hydrogel could offer a moist and occlusive environment for the wound, it is thought to be a viable wound dressing [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the moist environment created by hydrogel is also favorable to microb's invasion and growth, increasing the risk of wound infection [ 15 , 16 ] . So, antimicrobial agents, such as inorganic antimicrobial nanoparticles, antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, etc, are always encapsulated in the hydrogel to defend against microbial infection [17] . Nowadays, peptide-based hydrogels gain increasing attention from researchers due to their chemical simplicity and versatility [ 18 , 19 ] . Among them, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) formed antimicrobial hydrogels show their great advantages in treating infected wounds. AMPs exhibit a broad range of biological properties, including antibacterial activity, antiinflammatory activity, cell proliferation and migration-promoting activity, angiogenesis-promoting activity, and so on [ 20 , 21 ] . Although some antimicrobial peptides have appeared to drug resistance to some extent [22] , it is believed that AMPs exert their antibacterial activity through the membrane related action mode and it is not easy to induce bacterial resistance [23] . More importantly, its action is not affected by the bacterial resistance mechanism of conventional antibiotics, so they were considered as ideal alternatives to antibiotics against bacterial infection, especially drugresistant bacterial infection [ 24 , 25 ] ."
Introduction,"Wound healing involves the complex combination and synergy of various processes such as tissue regeneration, granulation tissue hyperplasia, scar tissue formation and so on [ 26 , 27 ] . The nutrition and oxygen support and growth factors play an important role in wound healing [28] . However, diabetes can cause local blood deficiency, lead to the failure of nutrients, oxygen and growth factors to reach the wound and result in chronic or refractory wounds [29] . Exogenous growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), could improve this dilemma and accelerate the healing process of diabetic wounds [30] [31] [32] . However, the extensive clinical application of these exogenous growth factors was hindered by their high cost, immunogenicity, and instability [ 33 , 34 ] . 8-Bromoadenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cAMP), a derivative of cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), was found could significantly promote the expression and secretion of the above-mentioned growth factors and promote cell migration [35] . It would be an alternative to growth factors for promoting wound healing. However, continuous and sustained release of a certain concentration of 8Br-cAMP was needed to stimulate the secretion of growth factors on the wound surface. In the present study, we developed an antibacterial hy-drogel constructed of a natural antimicrobial peptide Jelleine-1 (J-1) and 8Br-cAMP sodium in phosphate named J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel, without any other gelators or chemical crosslinking agents (Scheme 1a) . J-1 was first isolated from the royal jelly of the honeybee with a sequence of PFKLSLHL-NH 2 (953.57 Da) and showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and neglected cytotoxicity. The J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel could be regarded as a ""carrierfree"" hydrogel system, which could ""self-deliver"" J-1 and 8Br-cAMP to wound. In addition, it showed good antibacterial activity and the ability to upregulate the expression of growth factor genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and wound tissues. What's more, it could accelerate the healing of MRSA infected diabetic wounds and showed potential to be used as a wound dressing (Scheme 1b) ."

Both the mice and rats were housed in the animal room and enough food and water were freely available. In the present study, each animal was used only once. We try our best to minimize the number and suffering of the experimental animals. All the experiments in this study were carried out under the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC). The Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University's School of Basic Medical Sciences authorized all protocols in this study (Permit Number: jcyxy20211102)."
Preparation of the hydrogel,"As described previously, antimicrobial peptide J-1 was synthesized by classical solid-phase peptide synthesis assay [36] . The peptide was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on C18 columns and confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS, maXis 4G, Bruker, Germany). Before use, J-1 was dissolved in methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock solution with a concentration of 100 mM. Then J-1 stock solution was added to 10 mM 8Br-cAMP phosphate solution at different final concentrations to make J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel."
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was employed to characterize the nano-structural morphology of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel. 10 μL of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was mounted on a clean and dry silicon slice. Then the silicon slice was washed with deionized water twice carefully and dried at room temperature overnight. Finally, the sample was coated with gold and observed by FE-SEM (SU8020, Hitachi, Japan)."
Fluorescence spectrum experiment,"According our previous report, 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) and Thioflavin (Th T) fluorescent spectrum experiments were conducted to monitor the hydrophobic region and β-sheet structure change during the formation of hydrogel [37] . In addition, fluorescence emission spectra of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel/J-1 solution (excitation at 280 nm, emission data range between 300 and 450 nm) were measured to explore the role of ππ stacking in the formation of the hydrogel according previous study [ 38 , 39 ] ."
Rheological analysis,"The rheological properties of the hydrogel were characterized on a rheometer (Thermo HAAKE RS60 0 0, USA) using oscillation mode and all the tests were applied at 25 °C. The strain sweep was performed from 0.1% to 10 0 0% to determine the linear viscoelastic regime (LVR) with a frequency of 1 Hz. The step-strain time sweep was conducted to determine the shear-thinning and self-healing properties of the hydrogel with the frequency of 1 Hz. Time sweep was performed for 30 min with a frequency of 1 Hz and strain of 1%. A frequency sweep was conducted from 1 to100 rad/s with a strain of 1%."
The effects of the hydrogel on HUVECs in vitro,"Due to 8Br-cAMP was verified to promote the angiogenesis, the effect of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on the secretion of growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) in HUVECs were accessed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). First, the HUVECs were cultured in Ham's F-12K supported with 10% fetal bovine at 37 °C in a carbon dioxide cell incubator. After being treated with the hydrogel for 12, 24, 48 h, the cells were collected and the total RNA was extracted by TRIZOL (Accurate Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China)."
The effects of the hydrogel on HUVECs in vitro,"Then the relative expression of bFGF, HGF, PDGF, TGF-β, and VEGFA were determined by the RT-PCR instrument (QuantStudio 3, ABI, USA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) was used as a reference gene. The primers used in the present study were: GADPH-F: 5 -GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3 , GADPH-R: 5 -TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-3 ; bFGF-F: 5 -CAGCACTGCCTGAGT AGTTTTGA-3 ; bFGF-R: 5 -TGGAAGGGTCTCCCGCATA-3 ; HGF-F: 5 -GTCATTGTTCCTGGTCGTGG-3 , HGF-R: 5 -GACAGTTGTATTGGTGGGT GCT-3 ; PDGF-F: 5 -CAGGACGGTCATTTACGAGATT-3 , PDGF-R:"

The effects of the hydrogel on HUVECs in vitro,"Further, the expression of bFGF, HGF, PDGF, TGF-β, and VEGFA of HUVECs after incubating with the hydrogel for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h was quantified using ELISA kits (Shanghai FANKEWEI, China)."
The effects of the hydrogel on HUVECs in vitro,"Then, a cell scratch wound assay was performed to evaluate the cell migration ability of the hydrogel. HUVECs were seeded in 6-well plates at the density of 3 × 10 5 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then a scratch wound was made in each well by a 200 μL pipette tip and the planktonic cells were removed. Then ham's F-12K/hydrogel was added. Images of the scratch were recorded after 0, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h treatment by Ham's F-12K and hydrogel."
Biocompatibility of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel,"The cytotoxicity of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was determined against HUVECs was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and live/dead staining assay. Briefly, the hydrogel was placed into each well of the 96-well microtiter plate at 100 μL/well. Then 100 μL of Ham's F-12K was added to the surface of hydrogel in each well and balanced for 24 h. After discarding the medium in each well, 100 μL of HUVECs at the concentration of 1 × 10 4 cells/mL were seeded into each well and cultured in a cell incuba-tor with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. For the LDH release assay, 50 μL of supernatant from each well was collected and mixed with 50 μL LDH substrate mixture to determine the release of LDH of HUVECs after treating by the hydrogel according to the protocol of a commercial LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Beyotime). The LDH release rate was calculated as the following equation: LDH release rate % = OD 490 ( sample ) -OD 490 ( blank ) OD 490 ( Max ) -OD 490 ( blank ) × 100 , where the sample was the cell culture supernatant in the presence of the hydrogel, and the blank was just the cell culture medium in the absence of the cell to eliminate the background. Max was the cell culture supernatant without hydrogel and treated with LDH releasing agents according to the LDH kits. Besides, the cytotoxicity of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel to NIH3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells were also detected by LDH assay. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the hydrogel to HUVECs, NIH3T3, and RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according previous study [40] . And the cytotoxicity of J-1 and 8-Br-cAMP to HUVECs, NIH3T3, and RAW 264.7 cells was also determined by MTT assay."
Biocompatibility of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel,"For a live/dead assay, the cells in each well were washed three times after removing the supernatant from each well first. Then 5 μM of Calcein-AM and 50 μM of PI were added to each well and incubated at 37 C for another 30 and 15 min, respectively. Finally, the stained cells were observed by fluorescence microscope (U-LH50HG, Olympus, Japan)."
Biocompatibility of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel,"The hemolytic activity of the hydrogel was determined by calculating the hemolysis rate and observing the morphology of the human red blood cells. Firstly, human red blood cells were collected and washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Then, 8% (v/v) red blood cells were added to Eppendorf (EP) tubes pre-coated with the hydrogel and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After centrifuging at 1200 g for 15 min, the supernatant of red blood cells was collected to determine optical density at 490 nm. The hemolysis rate was calculated as the following equation: Hemolysis rate % = OD 490 ( sample ) -OD 490 ( blank ) OD 490 ( positive ) -OD 490 ( blank ) × 100 . The morphology of the red blood cells was observed by the inverted fluorescence microscope (U-LH50HG, Olympus, Japan). PBS and 1% Triton X-100 were used as negative control and positive control, respectively."
In vitro and in vivo degradation of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel,"The in vitro degradation of the hydrogel was investigated by detecting the mass loss of the hydrogel over time, according to the previous report [41] . Briefly, 500 μL of the hydrogel was first added into the weighed EP tube, and its initial mass was recorded as m 0 . Then, 200 μL of PBS was added to the surface of the hydrogel and incubated at 37 °C. 24 h Latter, PBS was removed and the mass of the residual hydrogel was recorded as m t . Following, 200 μL of PBS was added to the surface of the hydrogel and incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C. Repeating this step every day until no hydrogel could be observed in the EP tube. Then, the stability of J-1 against broad spectrum protease proteinase K was determined. Firstly, J-1 (1 mg/mL) was incubated with the proteinase K (100 μg/mL) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min. Then acetonitrile was added at different time point to inactivate the enzyme and terminate the reaction. Finally, the mixture were analyzed by HPLC."
In vitro and in vivo degradation of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel,"The B-ultrasonic instrument (Voluson E10, GE, USA) was used to monitor the in vivo degradation of the hydrogel in the present study. The hydrogel was injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the mice first. Then the size of the hydrogel in the subcutaneous tissue was determined and recorded by the B-ultrasonic instrument at an indicated time interval till the hydrogel could not be detected. Finally, the skin was collected and fixed with the 4% for-malin solution for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and histological examination."
In vitro antimicrobial activity of the hydrogel,"The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the hydrogel was determined as described previously [42] . In short, first, 400 μL of the hydrogel was injected into a sterile EP tube. Then, 400 μL of bacterial suspension with a concentration of 1 × 10 5 CFU/mL were added onto the hydrogel surface and incubated in an incubator at 37 °C. Finally, 50 μL of the bacterial suspension were taken out at indicated time interval (0, 2, 4, and 8 h) and spread on the agar plate after diluting properly. After 18 h incubation at 37 °C, the colonies on the agar plate were counted and photographed. The bacteria incubated in the sterile EP tube with the hydrogel was used as a negative control."
Wound healing effects of the hydrogel in diabetic rat wound infected by MRSA,"Male diabetic rats, which were created by high-fat diet (88.8% basic diet, 1% cholesterol, 10% lard and 0.2% bile salt), feeding for 4 weeks and injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dosage of 35 mg/kg as described previously, were used to establish the MRSA infected diabetic wound rat model [43] [44] [45] . First, 24 h after shaving the back of the rats, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital at the dosage of 50 mg/kg and a circular full-thickness skin wound with a diameter of 8 mm was created on its back with scissors. Then, 50 μL of MRSA suspension at the concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU/mL was seeded on the wounds. Following, the rats were randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups, treated with 0.9% saline and hydrogel every day, respectively. On days 3, 7, 14, and 21, the wounds were photographed, and the wound closure rates were calculated. At the same time, at each time point, five rats were sacrificed and the wound tissues were collected for bacterial colony counting, total RNA extraction, and histological analysis. The wound tissue was homogenized in PBS and spread on the agar plate for colony counting after incubation 18 h at 37 °C. The total RNA in wound tissue was extracted by TRIZOL (Accurate Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) assay and the relative expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-β, and VEGFA in the wound tissue at the RNA level was determined by real-time PCR instrument (QuantStudio 3, ABI, USA) and analyzed by the 2 -CT method. GADPH was used as a reference gene in the present study. The primers used in this experiment were: GADPH-F: 5 -TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3 , GADPH-R: 5 -TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-3 ; IL-6-F: 5 -CCACTTCA CAAGTCGGAGGCTTA-3 , IL-6-R, 5 -TGCAAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTC-3 ; TGF-β-F, 5 -ACCGCAACAACGCCATCT-3 , TGF-β-R: 5 -CCCGAATGT CTGACGTATTGAA-3 ; VEGFA-F: 5 -ACATTGGCTCACTTCCAGAAACAC-3 , VEGFA-R: 5 -TGGTTGGAACCGGCATCTTTA-3 . The wound tissues on days 14 and 21 were fixed with 4% formalin solution, paraffin sectioned, and stained with H&E and Masson, respectively, for histological examination."
Systemic toxicity of the hydrogel,"To evaluate the possible systemic toxicity of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel, the main organs of the rats were collected after 21 days of treatment with the hydrogel on the wounds. Then the harvested heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung tissue were fixed with 4% formalin solution for routine paraffin section. Finally, H&E staining was performed to evaluate the effect of the hydrogel on the heart, liver, spleen, kidney and lung tissue."
The skin toxicity of the hydrogel,"In this study, male Kunming mice were used to determine the hydrogel's skin toxicity according to a previous study with minor modification [46] . In short, the back skin of the mouse was shaved 24 h before the experiment first. Then, 200 μL of the hydrogel was applied to the shaved area and the change in the skin was observed and recorded for three days. 0.9% saline was used as a negative control. Finally, the skin treated with the hydrogel and 0.9% saline was collected and fixed with 4% formalin solution for H&E staining and histological examination."
Statistical analysis,All results were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) in the present study. The data were analyzed by GraphPad 8.0. The student's t -test (two-tailed) was employed to analyze the data between two independent groups. P < 0.05 was considered as significant difference.
Preparation and characterization of the hydrogel,"To obtain the peptide hydrogel, J-1 (Fig. S1 ) was synthesized by the classical solid-phase assay as described previously [36] , confirmed by ultrahigh-resolution TOF-MS, and purified by RP-HPLC. Its MS spectrum and RP-HPLC analytical spectrum are shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 , respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1 a, the hydrogel was formed by adding J-1 (6 mM) into an 8Br-cAMP (Fig. S4 ) phosphate solution, which was consisted of 8Br-cAMP sodium, NaH 2 PO 4 , Na 2 HPO 4 , NaCl and KCl with a certain proportion, in which the water molecules were captured and their fluidity was limited. When the FE-SEM was employed to observe the inner microstructure of the hydrogel, nanofiber bundles or nanofibrous bands formed by J-1 could be observed ( Fig. 1 b ). It is believed that the assembly of peptides is driven by non-covalent forces, such as hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding [47] . In the present study, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and ππ stacking were involved in the formation the hydrogel (Figs. S5-S7 ) and 8Br-cAMP were identified to take part in the formation of the hydrogel (Fig. S8 ). Results mentioned above indicated that J-1 could self-assemble into nanofibers in an 8Br-cAMP phosphate solution and interweaved each other to form a sufficiently dense nanofiber network to trap water molecules to form a self-supporting hydrogel."
Rheological analysis of the hydrogel,"The viscoelasticity of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was evaluated by a rheological test. In the present study, the storage modulus (G ) and the loss modulus (G ) were recorded as a function of strain, frequency, and time. As shown in Fig. 1 c , G was larger than G at lower strain, indicating the hydrogel formation [48] . As the strain rose, there was a crossover between G and G at the strain of 18%, G turned to be greater than G , indicating a gel-sol transition [49] . The frequency sweep result showed that both G and G slightly increased with the gradual rise of frequency in the range of 1-100 rad/s and G was always greater than G ( Fig. 1 d ). This indicated the dynamic nature of non-covalent bonds, such as the H-bond in the crosslinked network of hydrogel, and further confirmed its solid viscoelastic property [50] . Then the changes of G and G values during the following gelation at 1% strain and 1 Hz frequency were observed for 1800 s. Both G and G values increased slightly in the same manner and G kept larger than G , indicating a more and more stable elastic state ( Fig. 1 e ). This suggested that the hydrogel had the potential for biological application. Further, the step-strain measurement was performed at a frequency of 1 Hz. As shown in Fig. 1 f, the G was greater than G at the low strain of 1%, indicating the formation of a network of hydrogel, while switching to a high strain of 100%, G surpassed G immediately and kept for this state during the test period, indicating the gel-sol transition and the elapse of the network of the hydrogel at high strain. Next, when the strain was switched from 100% to 1%, the G and G recovered back to the initial levels, indicating a sol-gel transition. It was noticed that gel-sol state transition corresponded to a low-high strain switch during the five cycles of step-strain-sweep. These results showed that the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel network exhibited a reversible construction of noncovalent bonds responsible for its self-healing. In addition, these results also demonstrated that the hydrogel could undergo shear thinning and recover rapidly, thus allowing injection of the hydrogel into the interest site without permanent loss of hydrogel properties. An extrusion experiment was performed by a syringe with 26 a G needle to verify its injectability. As shown in Fig. 1 g, the hydrogel was injected into a culture dish and drew a character ""LZU"". It is evident that the hydrogel could immediately recover to the gel state and present a three-dimensional letter on the plate."
The effects of the hydrogel on the growth factors secretion and the migration of HUVECs,"Since the 8Br-cAMP could stimulate the secretion of growth factors and promote cell migration and angiogenesis [51] , the effect of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on the secretion of growth factors in HUVECs was determined. The results showed that the hydrogel could upregulate the expression of bFGF, HGF, TGF-β, and VEGFA in the HUVECs in both transcriptional level and protein level. While J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel did not induce increased expression of PDGF ( Figs. 2 a-e & S9 ). Correspondently, the hydrogel enhanced the migration of HUVECs and accelerated the closure of cell-free gaps ( Fig. 2 g ), which would be attributed to the growth factors secreted by the HUVECs, because the increased expression of VEGF could promote a range of cellular activities in endothelial cells, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation [34] . This indicated that the hydrogel had the potential for the treatment of chronic/refractory wounds caused by inadequate local secretion of growth factors and insufficient blood supply, such as diabetic wounds, which were characterized by reduced growth factor release, impaired angiogenesis, prolonged inflammation, and increased oxidative stress [52] ."
Cytotoxicity of the hydrogel,"The potent effect of the hydrogel on cell motility promoted us to explore its biocompatibility, which was very important for its further biomedical application [27] . The present study determined the cytocompatibility and blood-compatibility of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel. To explore its cytocompatibility, LDH release assay, cell live/dead assay, and MTT assay were employed. As shown in Fig. 2 f, the LDH release from HUVECs treated with the hydrogel for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively, were not significantly different from the correspondent normal culture plate group. As shown in Fig. S10 & 11, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel also behaved with low toxicity to NIH3T3, RAW 264.7 cells, HUVECs cells in the LDH release assay and MTT assay. However, 8Br-cAMP and J-1 in soluble form behaved cell toxicity at 256 μM (Fig. S12 ), which indicated that gelation could reduce the cytotoxicity of 8Br-cAMP and J-1."
Cytotoxicity of the hydrogel,"As shown in Fig. 2 h, the cells in the hydrogel-treated group showed the same proliferation trend as the negative control group after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h incubation. In addition, no significant difference between the morphology of the cells and the staining of calcein-AM (staining with live cells and showing green fluorescence) and PI (staining with dead cells and showing red fluorescence) under a fluorescence microscopic view between hydrogel treated group and the negative control group was observed. Next, the hemolysis of the hydrogel against human red blood cells was determined as an indicator of blood-biocompatibility. After incubating for 1 h, almost no hemoglobin was released from the erythrocytes in the hydrogel group; In contrast, 100% release was observed in the positive control group ( Fig. 2 i & j ). This result was consistent with the microscopic examination of red blood cells, which revealed that practically all red blood cells in the negative control and the hydrogel-treated groups were round and undamaged, whereas red blood cells in the positive control group were disrupted (Fig. S13 ). These findings indicated that the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel possessed exceptional biocompatibility and potential for additional biological applications."
Biodegradation of the hydrogel,"Biodegradation would be an important factor in the development of wound dressings because the treatment of residual dressings would cause secondary damage to the new wound tissues and burden both patients and doctors [ 53 , 54 ] . The in vitro degradation of the hydrogel was determined by weighing the remaining mass of hydrogel after incubation with PBS for a certain period. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the hydrogel mass gradually decreased and the hydrogel could degrade completely on the 22nd day at the near physiological pH of 7.4. Notably, the pH environment affected the degradation of the hydrogel and the degradation rate had a basically linear relation with incubation time in PBS at different pH solutions. At a lower pH solution, the hydrogel degraded more quickly than at higher a pH solution. This indicated that the hydrogel could rapidly and sustainedly release antimicrobial peptides and 8Br-cAMP to the wound site, since bacterial infections were considered to make the wound site weak acidity [55] . Furthermore, the stability of J-1 against broad spectrum protease proteinase K was determined by HPLC assay. The results showed that J-1 could be almost degraded completely after incubation with proteinase-K for 2 h (Fig. S14 ). The in vivo degradation of hydrogel was monitored by B-mode ultrasonography. As shown in Fig. 3 b, despite the effects of mouse movement and tissue extrusion, it took 10 days for the hydrogel injected subcutaneously on the back of the mouse to be completely degraded. In addition, J-1 could be almost completely degraded by the proteases in the serum within hours as we reported previously [56] . These results showed that the hydrogel was biodegradable and did not require additional clearance of residues after exerting its effects as wound dressings. Then the skin tissues in the hydrogel injection area were collected for the H&E staining. As shown in Fig. S15 , there were no obvious tissue lesions on the skin tissue treated by hydrogel, which suggested that the hydrogel behaved with potent biocompatibility."
Antibacterial activity of the hydrogel,"One of the advantages of hydrogel dressings is that they could provide a moist environment for wound healing. However, the moist environment was conducive to bacteria invading the wound surface and causing infection, which would trigger severe inflammation response and was not conducive to wound healing [ 16 , 57 ] ."
Antibacterial activity of the hydrogel,"In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was evaluated by a colony counting assay. Fig. 3 c & d show the change of logarithm of colony number and the colony formation of S. aureus and E. coli suspension at the concentration of 1 × 10 5 CFU/mL on the agar plate after incubation with hydrogel for the indicated time interval. The colony number of S. aureus ( Fig. 3 c ) and E. coli ( Fig. 3 d ) decreased to zero after incubation with hydrogel for 4 h and 2 h, respectively. Correspondingly no colony growing on the agar plate (Fig. S16 ). Considering that infection is one of the main complications of diabetic wounds and would further worsen diabetic wounds, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel would be an ideal wound dressing that can protect the wound from bacterial infection."
Wound healing efficacy of the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on diabetic wounds infected by MRSA,"Due to the remarkable in vitro antibacterial activity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel, its wound healing efficacy and in vivo antimicrobial activity were further investigated in a diabetic wound infected with MRSA . As shown in Fig. 4 a, although there was no significant difference in wound healing between the hydrogel group and the control group on day 3, the wound in the hydrogel group decreased significantly on day 7 and day 14 with a wound closure rate of 70.17 ± 3.5% and 93.82 ± 1.86%, respectively, while the wound closure rate in the control group was 45.39 ± 5.7% and 82.98 ± 4.9% on day 7 and day 14, respectively (shown in Fig. 4 b ). The hydrogel's wound healing properties were further verified and confirmed using the H&E and Masson staining assays. As illustrated in Fig. 4 c , the epidermis of the wound in the hydrogel treatment group almost entirely healed, and some skin attachments occurred on day 14, whereas the wound in the control group did not. Although the wound closure rate was not significantly different between the hydrogel treated and control wounds on day 21, the density of blood vessels and hair follicles in the hydrogel treatment group was much higher than that in the control group. In addition, recovery of the muscle layer, granulation tissue and other skin attachments of the hydrogel treated group also was much better than that in the control group. This showed that hydrogel could accelerate wound healing and shorten wound healing time."
Wound healing efficacy of the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on diabetic wounds infected by MRSA,"As we all know, wound healing is a complex process, which is affected by many factors, such as bacterial colony load, expression of inflammatory factors and secretion of related growth factors [ 58 , 59 ] . To explore how J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel promotes wound healing in a rat MRSA infected diabetic wound model, its effects on the proliferation of MRSA loaded on the wound and the expression of inflammatory factors and growth factors in the wound tissue were further determined next. As shown in Fig. 4 d , the MRSA colony counts in the hydrogel treated group were sig- nificantly lower than that in the control group in all the indicated time intervals, indicating that the hydrogel significantly and sustainedly inhibited the proliferation of MRSA in the wound. Although hydrogel dressings could keep the wound moist and are conducive to wound healing, but the bacterial infection is prone to occur in the wound and worsens the wound in the moist environment [16] . From this perspective, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel showed continuous antimicrobial activity in wounds and it would be an ideal candidate for wound dressing. In addition, the hydrogel could down-regulate the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the wound tissue on day 3 and day 7 (Fig. S17 ), which could be rapidly expressed when injury or infection occurred, and quickly participated in the defense response to the environmental stimuli [ 60 , 61 ] . The decreased expression of IL-6 showed that the hydrogel could alleviate the inflammatory response of tissues to environmental stimuli at the acute stage of trauma and infection. This result further verified that the hydrogel could promote wound healing and inhibit bacterial proliferation in wounds. Even more concerning, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel upregulated the expression of the growth factors TGF-β and VEGFA in the wound tissue, as shown in Fig. 4 e &  f. This would be attributed to the effect of 8Br-cAMP, which had been proved to promote growth factor secretion and angiogenesis [ 33 , 35 , 51 ] . The result also indicated that the sustained release of 8Br-cAMP from the hydrogel could be absorbed by wound tissue cells and affect their gene expression. In other words, the hydrogel could effectively deliver 8Br-cAMP to wound tissue and play its biological function. One of the reasons why diabetic wounds are difficult to heal is a lack of secretion of growth factors in the wound tissue, thereby affecting their local angiogenesis and oxygen and energy supply [ 28 , 52 , 62 ] . To this end, the hydrogel could release 8Br-cAMP continuously to the wound tissue and promote the sustained high expression of growth factors, indicating that it had the potential to promote refractory wound healing."
Wound healing efficacy of the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on diabetic wounds infected by MRSA,"Due to its good antimicrobial activity and potential use as wound dressings for refractory wound, the effects of J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on the main organ of rats and skin was further evaluated in the present study. As shown in Fig. 5 , under microscopic view, no obvious changes in the biopsies of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney stained by H&E between the 21 days hydrogel treated group and control group were observed. This meant that hydrogel did not damage the vital organs of rats after a long-time treatment for the wounds. This result was in line with our expectations because the hydrogel was consisted of natural antibacterial peptides and bioactive compounds."
Wound healing efficacy of the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel on diabetic wounds infected by MRSA,"Due to the J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel being expected for use as wound dressing, its effect on the skin tissue or direct toxicity toward skin would be a major concern for its clinical applications. So, the direct toxicity of the hydrogel on the mouse skin was examined. As shown in Fig. S18 , no obvious skin lesions such as erythema, irritation, and peeling were observed for 3 days after treatment with the hydrogel, which was consistent with that in the control group. Further, histological examination of skin tissue revealed no difference in the epidermis and dermis between the mice in the hydrogel treated group and the control group (Fig. S19 ). This indicated that J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was safe for the skin and could be used as dressing directly without any other side reaction."
Conclusion,"In the present study, we constructed a self-healing and injectable carrier-free hydrogel with a natural antimicrobial peptide J-1 and 8Br-cAMP by eco-friendly physical crosslinking without any other gelators or chemical crosslinking agents. Under the FE-SEM microscopy, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel was a dense network structure crosslinked by nanofiber bundles or nanobelts formed by J-1 self-assembled nanofibers. It degraded linearly and could continuously release and self-deliver AMP J-1 and 8Br-cAMP to the wound tissue, sustainedly inhibiting bacteria proliferation and upregulating the expression of growth factor VEGFA and TGF in the wound tissue so as to promote the healing of MRSA infected diabetic wounds. Considering its potent in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility, J-1-8Br-cAMP hydrogel would be an ideal candidate for wound dressings for the treatment of infected diabetic wounds. Therefore, this study would provide a potential dressing for infected diabetic wounds, and provide an efficient strategy to construct carrier-free hydrogel systems with nanofibers, condensed antimicrobials or other functional agents."
abstract,"Bacterial infection and local growth factor deficiency are two of the major causes of the nonunion of diabetic wounds. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are believed to be alternatives to antibiotics against drug-resistant bacterial infections. 8-Bromoadenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cAMP) can promote cells to secrete growth factors and accelerate cell proliferation. In the present study, we constructed a hydrogel with antimicrobial peptide Jelleine-1 (J-1) and 8Br-cAMP without any other gelators or chemical crosslinking agents. The hydrogel was proved to promote the secretion of transforming growth factorβ (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) in vitro and in vivo . Notably, it exhibited potent potential for wound healing in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) infected diabetic wounds. This would be attributed to the retention of AMPs and 8Br-cAMP on the wound site by the hydrogel system. In addition, the hydrogel also showed good biodegradability, proper stability, and good biocompatibility. This study would shed light on the development of carrier-free and multifunctional hydrogel for wound healing."
